# ‚öôÔ∏è  Dotfiles

A personal collection of config files to some tools like neovim, awesomewm and others.
Besides the files, this repository show the main tools used and how to install
these configurations.

P.S. I have used many sources and snippets for this collection, so this collection
is not an original project. Thanks to the FOSS comunity!
